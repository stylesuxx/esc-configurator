  "PWM_THRESHOLD_HIGH": "Above this throttle, a 24kHz PWM signal will be used.",
  "FORCE_EDT_ARM": "Only arm after successfull EDT handshake. Flight controller firmware has to support this feature.",
  "ESC_PROTOCOL": "Select the ESC protocol you want to use. This is for safety, with a preselected esc protocol, false throttle signale detections are prevented!",
  "RCPULSE_FILTER": "Values above 0 will enable the RC pulse filter, the higher the number the more aggressive the filter. Only use to compensate for really bad tunes.",
