  "STARTUP_BEEP": "当电调启动时启用哔哔响音乐。",
  "BRAKE_ON_STOP": "电机停止时立刻刹停电机。",
  "BEACON_DELAY": "After how much time of inactivity the beacon should start to go off.",
  "TEMPERATURE_PROTECTION": "在达到此温度时关闭电调。",
  "BEEP_STRENGTH": "启动时电调的音调。此数值设置过高会伤害电机。",
  "BEACON_STRENGTH": "The volume of the beacon. Setting this too high might damage the motors.",
  "STARTUP_POWER_MIN": "The least amount of power applied when starting up the motors. Increase if motors are not able to start up with low throttle input.",
  "DITHERING": "Increases the effective pwm resolution 2000 steps. It is generally recommended to leave this on especially with pwm frequencies above 24kHz.",
  "STARTUP_POWER_MAX": "Limits power when starting motors or reversing direction.",
  "RPM_POWER_SLOPE": "Limits how much power can be increased according to how fast the motor is spinning. Lower values will avoid power spikes but can also decrease acceleration and maximum attainable speed.",
  "MOTOR_DIRECTION": "The motor rotation direction can be normal or reversed. In bidirectional mode, center throttle is zero.",
  "COMMUTATION_TIMING": "Motor commutation advance timing. Higher timing are less prone to desyncs and can provide more power at the cost of efficiency.",
  "DEMAG_COMPENSATION": "The extent to which power should be cut to protect against motor stalls caused by long winding demagnetization time after commutation."
