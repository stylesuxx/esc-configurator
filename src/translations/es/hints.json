  "BEACON_DELAY": "After how much time of inactivity the beacon should start to go off.",
  "TEMPERATURE_PROTECTION": "At which temperature the ESC will shut down.",
  "BEEP_STRENGTH": "The volume of the startup beeps. Setting this too high might damage the motors.",
  "BEACON_STRENGTH": "The volume of the beacon. Setting this too high might damage the motors.",
  "STARTUP_POWER_MIN": "The least amount of power applied when starting up the motors. Increase if motors are not able to start up with low throttle input.",
  "DITHERING": "Increases the effective pwm resolution to 2000 steps. It is recommended to leave this on with a pwm frequency above 24kHz.",
  "STARTUP_POWER_MAX": "Limits power when starting motors or reversing direction.",
  "RPM_POWER_SLOPE": "Limits how much power can be increased according to how fast the motor is spinning. Lower values will avoid power spikes but can also decrease acceleration and maximum attainable speed.",
  "MOTOR_DIRECTION": "The motor rotation direction can be normal or reversed. In bidirectional mode, center throttle is zero.",
  "COMMUTATION_TIMING": "Motor commutation advance timing. Higher timing are less prone to desyncs and can provide more power at the cost of efficiency.",

  "STALL_PROTECTION": "Increases throttle automatically below a rpm threshold to try and avoid stalling the motor, not recommended for multirotors.",
  "TIMING_ADVANCE": "Motor commutation advance timing. Higher timing are less prone to desyncs and can provide more power at the cost of efficiency.",
  "MOTOR_KV": "The KV rating of the motor stated by the manufacturer. The value is used to set RPM limit for low rpm throttle protection.",
  "MOTOR_POLES": "Pole count of the motor. This value is used to adjust sinusoidal startup speed.",
